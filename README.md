# *openchain.info*


## The Mission


The mission of the project is to develop an open  
source block explorer that not only will show the  
data of the bitcoin block chain but also allow  
everybody who encode any data into a blockchain  
to describe it linked to a raw chain data.  

The developers who work today to develop a value  
derivatives on top of a block chain like Color Coins  
or Mater Coins, betting service, or an escrow service  
are welcome to contribute to openchain.info.  


## Code Standard

Just make your commits look like other code  
Make comments if you are doing something unique  
and not trivial.

## Online

Once a while I will update the source  
on openchain.info webiste.
